Description: Provides an R interface to the Swedish 
    'Kolada' database API (<https://www.kolada.se/om-oss/api/>). 
    The Kolada database is a comprehensive collection of key indicators 
    and statistics regarding Swedish municipalities. This package 
    serves as a high-level wrapper, abstracting away the complexities of 
    the underlying web API. It offers functions to discover available 
    metadata, such as key performance indicators (KPIs) and 
    municipalities, and to fetch specific data points, returning them in 
    tidy data frames suitable for analysis in R.
